#### The Assignment

This assignment will look a lot like a regular workday for you. You have to make a change to some
existing code but when you open it... your heart stops... you start to sweat... you panic! The
code is complex, difficult to understand, violates coding principles, has bugs and of course no 
unit tests!

So... it is best to clean it up before making the changes!

Today you need to clean up the *BankmailResourceDataUtil* class.

#### The process

Create a feature branch and go wild refactoring the *BankmailResourceDataUtil* class. 

Make small commits with information about what the commit achieved (you are always doing 
that... right?). Having small commits means you isolate changes, so you can easily roll them back
later or cherry pick. It also ensures you always have a working situation, or only a limited
amount of work to rollback to get back to a working situation! 

Add javadoc when you feel that is needed for future developers (always consider yourself to be
the future developer that looks at that code for the first time). Be the developer that holds the
door open for the next developer, not the developer that slams it shut in the next developers face!

#### What will be reviewed

We will asses the code looking at the following:
- is the code "clean code"?
- is the code covered with unit tests?
- are coding principles applied (think SOLID)?
- are basic conventions followed?
- is consistent code styling/formatting being applied?
- is it technically/functionally correct?

We will also try to understand the decisions that have been made.
